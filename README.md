## Aim

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to provide a visualization of the distribution of American income for both U.S. and state level.

-   For U.S. level, we compared the percentile of total compensation for all workers with prime-age workers from 2005 to 2019.

-   For state level, we focused 50th percentile of total compensation in 2019 for all workers.

## Data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The raw data folder includes following CSV files:

-   `pctl_of_inc_us_w2`
-   `pctl_of_inc_state_w2`.

All these files are derived from "Percentiles of income module" of [Income Distributions and Dynamics in America: Data Center](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/institute/income-distributions-and-dynamics-in-america/data-center) on the [Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/). Also, a detailed description (`About_data.md`) of variables is contained in the same folder.

The Derived Data folder contains processed data, which is more suitable to draw plots. Similarly, please refer to `derived_data.md` for derived process.
